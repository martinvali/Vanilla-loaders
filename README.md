# Vanilla-loaders
A free collection of simple HTML&amp;CSS loading animations

Just a project I created for practice and learning. First time I've used SASS, Barba and Gulp in a project. The 3D illustrations were first modelled and then photographed in Blender, which was also a new experience for me. Overall, a good project for learning.
